A desktop application aimed at organising files and maintaining folder structures, such that files like documents or images will be filled correctly inside their respective folders a.k.a Documents, Images. This applies to most file types, the goal is to generalise down to the 4 types that Windows OS uses by default; Documents, Images, Videos, and Music. As these directories cover the main areas, or to precise the more common file types the all users would have. Other goals of this application is to extend out to such online 'cloud' storage websites such as onedrive or google drive and allow users to create a structure, or use a default one that mimics the Windows OS one. Some of the idea's planned for down the road will include some of the IOS concepts for structure within the application window itself.
